# DAPP tutorial 

This tutorial will take you through the process of building your first dapp.

This tutorial is meant for those with a basic knowledge of Ontology and smart contracts, who have some knowledge of HTML and JavaScript, but who are new to dapps.

In this tutorial we will be covering:

1. Setting up the development environment

2. Creating a Truffle project using a Truffle Box

3. Writing the smart contract

4. Compiling and migrating the smart contract

5. Testing the smart contract

6. Creating a user interface to interact with the smart contract

7. Interacting with the dapp in a browser

## Background



## Setting up the development environment

[Node.js v6+ LTS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/)

[DAPP Demo](https://github.com/OntologyCommunityDevelopers/ontology-dapi-demo)

Once we have those installed, we only need one command to install Demo:

```

npm install
npm run start

```


## Writing the smart contract


We'll start our dapp by writing the smart contract that acts as the back-end logic and storage.

### Compiling and deploy/invoke the smart contract

Now that we have written our smart contract, the next steps are to compile and deploy it.

### Migration smart contract

### Running the tests

##Interacting with the dapp in a browser

Now we're ready to use our dapp!

### Installing and configuring Cyano Wallet

The easiest way to interact with our dapp in a browser is through Cyano Wallet, a browser extension for Chrome.


## Using the dapp


### Start the local web server of demo:

```
npm run dev

```

The dev server will launch and automatically open a new browser tab containing your dapp.


### transfer or invoke smartcontract

To use the dapp, click the button.

### approve the transaction on Cyano Wallet

You'll be automatically prompted to approve the transaction by Cyano Wallet. Click Confirm to approve the transaction.
